## üß† What is DocuMind?


DocuMind is a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** assistant for PDFs and company docs.
It ingests documents, chunks them intelligently, indexes embeddings in a vector DB, and answers questions with **source-grounded** responses and **confidence scores**. Built for **speed, transparency, and trust**.


---
## Features
- Intelligent PDF ingestion and chunking
- Semantic search with Google Generative AI embeddings
- AI-powered question answering (Gemini 2.0)
- Source attribution: page numbers, file names, content previews
- Confidence scoring system (Very High to Very Low)
- Modern, responsive Streamlit web interface
- Dockerized for easy deployment (Hugging Face Spaces supported)

---
## üß™ Trust by Design


**Citations**
- Every answer lists **file names + page numbers** and **200-char snippet previews**.
- Clicking a citation focuses the exact passage (UI highlight).


---


**Anti-Hallucination Controls**
- Retrieval-strict prompts (‚Äúcite before claim‚Äù)
- Empty-answer allowed (better honest than wrong)
- Optional answer-length limiter + grounding checker

- Build an advanced RAG system that maintains conversation memory, handles multi-turn queries, and retrieves from multiple data sources (documents, databases, APIs).
- Include advanced chunking, re-ranking, and query expansion techniques.
- Tech Stack: LangChain/LlamaIndex, vector databases, Redis, FastAPI, advanced embedding models
- Success Metrics: Handle 10+ turn conversations, improve accuracy to 90%
